Tetris:
    Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field. During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them. The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank. Completing lines grants points and increase your score.

    The game is done by pygame module where it runs in a while loop calling member and object of a class and the background music is played using mixer module from pygame.
